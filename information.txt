– Angular CLI 12
-----------

Setup Angular 12 Project:

Let’s open cmd and use Angular CLI to create a new Angular Project as following command:

ng new Angular12JwtAuth
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS

We also need to generate some Components and Services:

ng g s _services/auth
ng g s _services/token-storage
ng g s _services/user

ng g c login
ng g c register
ng g c home
ng g c profile
ng g c board-admin
ng g c board-moderator
ng g c board-user

Aquii:

It configures CORS for port 8081, so you have to run command: ng serve --port 8081 instead.
> ng serve --port 8081


run
> ng serve
